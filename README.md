# Analysis of EV Adoption in California

---

Exploring the dataset can reveal various patterns and insights related to electric vehicle adoption, demographic characteristics, and economic factors. Here are some patterns we tried to explore and questions we tried to find answers for:

1. Electric Vehicle Adoption Patterns:

    - Question: How does the distribution of electric vehicles vary across different ZIP codes?
    - Patterns to Explore: Identify ZIP codes with high and low electric vehicle adoption rates. Investigate if certain regions show a higher preference for electric cars.

2. Demographic Correlations:

    - Question: Are there correlations between demographic characteristics and electric vehicle adoption?
    - Patterns to Explore:  Analyze the relationship between ethnicity, education level, and the percentage of electric vehicles. Explore if areas with higher income levels tend to have more electric vehicles.

3. Economic Factors:

    - Question: How do economic factors influence electric vehicle adoption?
    - Patterns to Explore: Examine the relationship between median household income and the prevalence of electric cars. Investigate if areas with higher home values show a greater affinity for electric vehicles.

4. Fuel Types and Preferences:

    - Question: What are the preferences for different types of alternative fuel vehicles?
    - Patterns to Explore: Compare the distribution of electric, hybrid, and other alternative fuel vehicles. Identify regions with a higher concentration of specific fuel types.

5. Predictive Modeling:

    - Question: Can we predict electric vehicle adoption based on demographic and economic factors?
    - Patterns to Explore: Build models to predict Total_EV or EV_perc. Evaluate the significance of different features in predicting electric vehicle adoption.
